  |   The world doesn't change with each new game, you do.                  |
  |                                                                         |

  |   Even a simple-looking-yet-amazing game like this takes a lot of       |
  |   time and big piles of money to make, but you can get it for only a    |
  |   few bucks.                                                            |

  |                                                                         |
